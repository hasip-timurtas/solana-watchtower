# Contributing to Solana Watchtower

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Solana Watchtower! We welcome contributions from the community and are grateful for your help in making this project better.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement:

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Create a detailed issue** with:
   - Clear description of the problem or suggestion
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details (OS, Rust version, etc.)
   - Relevant logs or screenshots

### Feature Requests

For new features:

1. **Open an issue** first to discuss the proposal
2. **Explain the use case** and why it would be valuable
3. **Consider the scope** - start with smaller, focused features
4. **Be prepared to implement** or help with implementation

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: 1.80+ (latest stable recommended)
- **Git**: For version control
- **Docker**: Optional, for testing containerized builds

### Local Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/solana-watchtower.git
cd solana-watchtower

# Create a development branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Install dependencies and build
cargo build

# Run tests to ensure everything works
cargo test

# Check code formatting and lints
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Format**: Use `cargo fmt` for consistent formatting
- **Linting**: Address all `cargo clippy` warnings
- **Comments**: Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- **Documentation**: Include doc comments for public APIs

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for new functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Add end-to-end tests when appropriate
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for good test coverage of core logic
- **Test Data**: Use realistic but anonymized test data

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
feat: add new monitoring rule for NFT transfers
fix: resolve WebSocket connection timeout issue
docs: update configuration examples
test: add unit tests for alert batching
refactor: improve error handling in subscriber
```

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/rule-engine-improvements`
- `fix/websocket-reconnection`
- `docs/api-documentation`
- `refactor/notification-system`

## üìù Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Ensure tests pass**: `./scripts/run-tests.sh`
2. **Update documentation** if needed
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Check security implications** of changes
5. **Verify Docker builds** work if relevant

### PR Requirements

- **Clear description** of changes and motivation
- **Link to related issues** using `Fixes #123` or `Closes #123`
- **Screenshots** for UI changes
- **Breaking changes** clearly documented
- **Security considerations** noted if applicable

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (CI/CD pipeline)
2. **Code review** by maintainers
3. **Security review** for sensitive changes
4. **Documentation review** for user-facing changes
5. **Final approval** and merge

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Guidelines

### Security-Sensitive Changes

For changes affecting security:

- **Follow responsible disclosure** for vulnerabilities
- **Review dependencies** for known issues
