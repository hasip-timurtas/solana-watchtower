# Security Policy

## Security Posture

Solana Watchtower takes security seriously. This document outlines our current security status, known issues, and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## Current Security Status

### ‚úÖ **Significantly Improved Security**
- **Fixed 3 out of 5 critical vulnerabilities** through dependency updates
- **Updated Solana SDK**: 1.16 ‚Üí 1.18
- **Updated Dependencies**: Prometheus, Validator, and other core libraries
- **Docker Security**: Using Rust nightly with latest security patches

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Remaining Issues**

The following security advisories are **acknowledged and documented**:

| Issue | Impact | Status | Rationale |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| `RUSTSEC-2022-0093` | ed25519-dalek double public key signing oracle attack | Accepted Risk | Comes from Solana 1.18.26 ecosystem |
| `RUSTSEC-2025-0009` | ring AES functions may panic with overflow | Low Impact | Solana transitive dependency |
| `RUSTSEC-2025-0010` | ring versions unmaintained | Low Impact | Solana ecosystem issue |

### üîÆ **Future Resolution Path**

These vulnerabilities can be resolved by:
- **Upgrading to Solana 2.x** (available but requires significant breaking changes)
- **Timeline**: Major upgrade planned for Q2 2025 roadmap
- **Current Status**: Not practical for immediate deployment due to extensive API changes required

## Vulnerability Assessment

### **Risk Level: LOW** ‚ö°

1. **Limited Attack Surface**: 
   - Vulnerabilities are in cryptographic libraries, not our application logic
   - Watchtower operates as a monitoring tool, not handling private keys or transactions
   
2. **Mitigation Factors**:
   - Read-only operations on blockchain data
   - No sensitive key material stored
   - Network monitoring only, no transaction signing

3. **Ecosystem Dependencies**:
   - Issues stem from Solana's dependency tree
   - Affect most Solana ecosystem projects using 1.18.x
   - Well-documented in security community

## Security Audit Configuration

We use `audit.toml` and `deny.toml` to:
- Document known acceptable risks
- Focus attention on new/actionable vulnerabilities  
- Maintain CI/CD pipeline stability
- Provide transparency about security decisions

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### **For Solana Watchtower Issues**
If you discover a security vulnerability in our application code:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email: [security@yourorg.com] (replace with actual email)
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if known)

### **For Dependency Issues**
For vulnerabilities in our dependencies:
- Report to the respective upstream projects (Solana, etc.)
- Create a GitHub issue labeled `security/dependency` for tracking

## Security Best Practices

When deploying Solana Watchtower:

- ‚úÖ Use latest Docker images
- ‚úÖ Run with minimal required permissions  
- ‚úÖ Keep configuration files secure
- ‚úÖ Monitor system logs
- ‚úÖ Regular dependency updates
- ‚úÖ Network isolation for monitoring instances
